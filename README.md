## ❓ Sample Questions & Answers  

**Q: Why did you use both CNN and RNN?**  
> CNN is effective for static image feature extraction, while RNN captures the sequence of gestures over time — combining both enables accurate dynamic gesture recognition.

**Q: What role does MediaPipe play in your system?**  
> MediaPipe detects hand landmarks with high precision, which serve as inputs for gesture recognition.

**Q: What challenges did you face during development?**  
> Handling variations in gestures, ensuring real-time processing, and achieving high accuracy under varying conditions.

**Q: How does your system ensure privacy?**  
> All video data is processed locally; nothing is stored or transferred externally.

**Q: Future improvements?**  
> Adding text-to-speech conversion, supporting multiple sign languages, and deploying as a web/mobile application.
